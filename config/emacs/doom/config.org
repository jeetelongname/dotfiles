#+TITLE: My configuration
#+STARTUP: content
* Introduction
This is my literate configuration for doom emacs. I barley know [[https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/elisp/][elisp]]  and I have
mostly stolen snippets from others. This config is [[elisp:(call-interactively #'count-words)][this many]] words, lines and
characters long. Its a lot of blood sweat and tears so I hope you like it as much
as I tolerate it!

Lets get this config started!

* Rudimentary configuration
This is the stuff that does not really belong in any module but is useful
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "Jeetaditya Chatterjee"
      user-mail-address "jeetelongname@gmail.com"
      doom-scratch-initial-major-mode 'lisp-interaction-mode
      auth-sources '("~/.authinfo.gpg")
      ispell-dictionary "en"
      display-line-numbers-type 'relative
      browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-firefox)
#+END_SRC
if a file has changed on disk I dont want that old file sticking around. that
can mess me up
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-auto-revert-mode t)
#+END_SRC

Frankly I don't know why this is not default
(it automatically switches to a split)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq evil-split-window-below  t
      evil-vsplit-window-right t)
#+END_SRC

I like a little separation so I put an empty line at the top of my emacs
instance (I may put something in it later)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default header-line-format
        (concat (propertize " " 'display '((space :align-to 0)))
                " "))
#+END_SRC
spawn emacs somewhat in the center of my screen
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let ((width  500)
      (height 250)
      (display-height (display-pixel-height))
      (display-width  (display-pixel-width)))
  (pushnew! initial-frame-alist
            `(left . ,(- (/ display-width 2) (/ width 2)))
            `(top . ,(- (/ display-height 2) (/ height 2)))
            `(width text-pixels ,width)
            `(height text-pixels ,height)))
#+END_SRC
** Quick fixes

** Keybinds
These are my general keybinds they should not belong to any module. thus they
get stuck here
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(map!
 :n "z C-w" 'save-buffer ; I can use this onehanded which is nice when I need to leave or eat or something
 :leader
 :desc "Enable Coloured Values""t c" #'rainbow-mode
 :desc "Toggle Tabs""t B" #'centaur-tabs-local-mode
 :desc "Open Elfeed""o l" #'elfeed


 (:after spell-fu (:map override ;; HACK spell-fu does not define a modemap
                   :n [return]
                   (cmds! (memq 'spell-fu-incorrect-face (face-at-point nil t))
                          #'+spell/correct))))
#+END_SRC

** Hooky hooks
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook! 'rainbow-mode-hook
  (hl-line-mode (if rainbow-mode -1 +1)))
;; this snippet can be replaced with `(after! magit (setq magit-save-repository-buffers t))'
;; (after! magit (add-hook! 'magit-status-mode-hook :append (call-interactively #'save-some-buffers)))
#+end_src

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(remove-hook 'text-mode-hook #'visual-line-mode)
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'auto-fill-mode)
(add-hook 'peep-dired-hook 'evil-normalize-keymaps)
#+END_SRC
** funky functions
Because this is a literate config I can't re evaluate the buffer using
~eval-buffer~ (bound to =SPC m e b=) so I reload the file
(=m e b= becomes =h r c=)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun yeet/reload ()
  "A simple cmd to make reloading m config easier"
  (interactive)
  (load! "config" doom-private-dir)
  (message "Reloaded!"))

(map! :leader
      "h r c" #'yeet/reload)
#+END_SRC

This was the begining of a paint intergration so that I could draw-in notes. I
could not find a program featurefull yet commandline enough to get it working, but
one day
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar yeet/paint-insert-prefix-dir (concat org-directory "pictures")
  "where to put the picture")
(defvar yeet/paint-ask t
  "Ask if you want to name the file if no it will be named you current buffer + picture")
(defvar yeet/paint-cmd "gnome-paint"
  "the program you want to use as your paint program")

(defun yeet/paint-insert()
  ""
  (interactive)
  (shell-command yeet/paint-cmd))
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun henlo ()
  "henlo."
  (interactive)
  (message "\"henlo\""))
(henlo)
#+END_SRC

I don't have a problem ok I can =M-x stop= at any time
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun stop ()
  (interactive)
  (defvar name "*I can quit at any time*")
  (switch-to-buffer (get-buffer-create name))
  (insert "I can stop at any time\nI am in control"))
#+end_src


This snippet toggles between a vertical and horizontal window. Like most things
I did not write this I took it from [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ToggleWindowSplit][here]]
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun toggle-window-split ()
  (interactive)
  (if (= (count-windows) 2)
      (let* ((this-win-buffer (window-buffer))
	     (next-win-buffer (window-buffer (next-window)))
	     (this-win-edges (window-edges (selected-window)))
	     (next-win-edges (window-edges (next-window)))
	     (this-win-2nd (not (and (<= (car this-win-edges)
					 (car next-win-edges))
				     (<= (cadr this-win-edges)
					 (cadr next-win-edges)))))
	     (splitter
	      (if (= (car this-win-edges)
		     (car (window-edges (next-window))))
		  'split-window-horizontally
		'split-window-vertically)))
	(delete-other-windows)
	(let ((first-win (selected-window)))
	  (funcall splitter)
	  (if this-win-2nd (other-window 1))
	  (set-window-buffer (selected-window) this-win-buffer)
	  (set-window-buffer (next-window) next-win-buffer)
	  (select-window first-win)
	  (if this-win-2nd (other-window 1))))))

* Packages
I have quite a few packages that I use. These are the packages and there
subsequent configurations
A nice little header
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el

*** vim
because sacrilege is fun
(this is mostly a mental exercise but it does work...) I can (alleged) also get lsp
support as well so this may be a fun project to take on
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! vimrc-mode)

#+END_SRC
*** discord rich presence
I use discord emacs over elcord .. well because I found it first this is pretty
much all that is needed for it to work and you can use the default client id to
get it working right away or if you want to roll your own .you can add assets by
calling them the file extension (go for golang py for python org for .. well you
know)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el

** Outside Influence
*** tldr integration
Ever wanted to.. not read a man page? me too. tldr is a good middle ground between
a lot of useless information and .. no information. Now in emacs!
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! tldr)

*** emacs application framework
eaf is an application framework for writing pyqt applications in emacs. Its
really cool!
https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d#orgad36696 this is a config I need to revisit
You need a few dependencies for this to work. I don't recommend installing from
pip as it can be buggy

#+begin_src shell :tangle no

*** pretty code shots
I missed the ability to make pretty code shots inside vscode now its come back to
me through this package. its pretty cool and works well (it only does one thing)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! carbon-now-sh)
#+end_src

I wanted to work with these code images directly in emacs so I brought in eaf to
help. Do note that there is a bug in the pypi version of the qtwebengine that
basically segfaults if you open carbon (and probably other sites) if you install
from the repos tho this problem goes away
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

to document what exists and just add a little more fun to the operating system
we call home
Some games I will probably add

By virtue of these things I seem to have 3 different sidebars (4 if you include
treemacs) that I have taken a liking to so they get there own sub genre

#+end_src
*** Dired sidebar
this is a replacement for treemacs. Now don't get me wrong. I like treemacs. Its
great but its /not dired/. This preserves a lot of the dired configuration I could
do and more importantly preserves keys which is nice
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el

this is the same thing as above made by the same [[https://github.com/jojojames][author]] and it works just like
dired sidebar.. for Ibuffer

bit of work to be done

settings and all of that fun stuff here

+Inconsolata is the best font that *I* have used... but it does not italic well.+
+if you do know of a better way. do get in touch!+

Iosevka is my new best friend

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq! doom-font
       (font-spec :family "Iosevka" :size 16)
       doom-big-font
       (font-spec :family "Iosevka" :size 25)
       doom-variable-pitch-font
       (font-spec :family "LibreBaskerville" :size 17))
#+end_src

the comments for horizon are borderline unreadable so now we have brighter
comments
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! doom-themes
  (setq! doom-themes-enable-bold t
         doom-themes-enable-italic t
         doom-horizon-brighter-comments t))
#+end_src

I wanted my comments and keywords to be italics. I may need to change fonts..
#+begin_src  emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(font-lock-comment-face :slant italic)
  '(font-lock-keyword-face :slant italic))
#+END_SRC

My theme
this will load up 2 different themes one for the terminal and one for the gui.
turns out that the emacs client works differently so this is not something that
I can use...
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; (require 'rose-pine-theme-moon)
(if (not (daemonp))
    (if (not (display-graphic-p))
        (setq doom-theme 'horizon)
      (setq doom-theme 'doom-horizon))
  (setq doom-theme 'doom-horizon))
#+end_src

*** Doom Dashboard

now this is my fancy splash image I need to move over to
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq fancy-splash-image (concat doom-private-dir "icons/emacs-icon.png"))
#+END_SRC

I am starting to experimenting with adding stuff to the dashboard
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook! '+doom-dashboard-functions :append
  (insert "\n" (+doom-dashboard--center +doom-dashboard--width "Get back to work")))
#+end_src

*** Modeline
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(after! doom-modeline
  (setq doom-modeline-buffer-file-name-style 'auto
        doom-modeline-height 30
        doom-modeline-icon 't
        doom-modeline-modal-icon 'nil
        doom-modeline-env-version t
        doom-modeline-buffer-modification-icon t
        doom-modeline-enable-word-count t
        doom-modeline-continuous-word-count-modes '(text-mode)
        doom-modeline-icon (display-graphic-p)
        doom-modeline-persp-name t
        doom-modeline-persp-icon t
        doom-modeline-github t
        doom-modeline-mu4e t))
#+END_SRC
This was all for a little padding. I could remove the stuff I don't need but
whats the fun in that?

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! doom-modeline
  (doom-modeline-def-modeline 'main
    '(bar workspace-name window-number modals matches buffer-info remote-host buffer-position word-count parrot selection-info)
    '(objed-state misc-info persp-name grip irc mu4e github debug repl lsp minor-modes input-method indent-info buffer-encoding major-mode process checker vcs "  " bar)))
#+end_src

I stole this from @tecosaur Its frankly a great addition (this is a theme
throughout @tecosaurs config)
As we expect that the encoding is UTF-8 we remove it from the modeline untill we
get something that is not normal
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(defun doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding ()
  "We expect the encoding to be LF UTF-8, so only show the modeline when this is not the case"
  (setq-local doom-modeline-buffer-encoding
              (unless (or (eq buffer-file-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)
                          (eq buffer-file-coding-system 'utf-8)))))

(add-hook! 'after-change-major-mode-hook #'doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding)

#+END_SRC

the persp name was too dark for my liking
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces! '(doom-modeline-persp-name :foreground "#e95678" :weight bold ))
#+end_src
*** FIXME Popup
this is my default pop up rule, all my popups are beaten into submission
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; (set-popup-rule! ".+"
;;   :side 'right
;;   :width 90
;;   :actions '+popup-display-buffer-stacked-side-window-fn
;;   :quit t)
;; (set-popup-rule! "COMMIT_EDITMSG"
;;   :side 'top
;;   :height 20)
#+END_SRC

*** DEPRECATED Tabs
I don't use tabs so a lot of this is not really maintained...
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(when (featurep! :ui tabs)
  (after! centaur-tabs
    (setq centaur-tabs-style "box"
          centaur-tabs-height 32
          centaur-tabs-set-bar 'under
          x-underline-at-descent-line t
          centaur-tabs-close-button "×"
          centaur-tabs-modified-marker "Ø")))
#+END_SRC
*** Treemacs
this provides a vscode like sidebar. I actually use dired a lot more but I guess
its still useful for presentation's
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(after! treemacs
  (setq +treemacs-git-mode 'extended
        treemacs-width 30))
#+END_SRC
** tools
*** TODO debugger
dap support in doom is meh so I a have added a little more. tbh I don't really
use a debugger (tho I should) its a little broken and go support seems to be
out so I will have to fix that eventually
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! dap-mode
  (setq dap-auto-configure-features '(sessions locals controls tooltip)
        dap-python-executable "python3"))
#+end_src

this does a thing
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'dap-stopped-hook
          (lambda () (call-interactively #'dap-hydra)))
#+end_src
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :leader "od" nil
      :leader "od" #'dap-debug
      :leader "dt" #'dap-breakpoint-toggle)
#+end_src
*** Magit
** emacs
*** dired
If I open 2 instances of dired in two different locations then move one. dired
will point the move to the other location
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq dired-dwim-target t)
#+end_src
** term
*** eshell
eshell is a repl like shell. it works like a shell but you can use elisp in line
and it does not handle tui apps (like htop) usually defering to ~ansi-term~
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-eshell-alias!
 "cls" "clear")
#+end_src

** lang
*** TODO Org
Org mode. our favorite plain text markup format! these are my configurations for
it
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-directory "~/org-notes/")
(after! org
  (setq
        org-agenda-files (list org-directory)
        org-hide-emphasis-markers t)

  (when (featurep! :lang org +pretty) ;; I used to use the +pretty flag but I now don't thus the `when'
    (setq org-fancy-priorities-list '("⚡" "⬆" "⬇" "☕")
          org-superstar-headline-bullets-list '("⁕" "܅" "⁖" "⁘" "⁙" "⁜"))))
#+end_src

As org has a lot of subheading's I wanted to tweak stuff ever so slightly thus
here we are. do note that I have copied all of the foreground info over that
becuse the ~inherit~ value (setter?, key? idk) did not exist untill I looked it
up it would have looked like ~..:inherit outline-x~ where x is the level of the
heading you want to change. This just locks me into the horizon colour scheme
but there are worst things. The better way would be to change ~outline-x~
directly
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(org-date :foreground "#5b6268")
  '(org-document-title :height 1.75 :weight bold)
  '(org-level-1 :foreground "#21bfc2" :height 1.3 :weight normal)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-roam-directory (concat org-directory "roam/")
      org-roam-db-location (concat org-roam-directory ".org-roam.db"))
#+end_src
*** Go
Go and lsp have not been behaving like they should. the file watchers have been
misbehaving and now they have been disabled for go mode. That fixes the issue
but means lsp will not watch files in the workspace (a small price to pay imo)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(after! go-mode ;; I have stopped using ligatures so this is not useful to me but it can be to you!
  (set-ligatures! 'go-mode
                  :def "func"
                  :true "true" :false "false"
                  :int "int" :str "string"
                  :float "float" :bool "bool"
                  :for "for"
                  :return "return" )
  )
(setq-hook! 'go-mode-hook
  lsp-enable-file-watchers nil)
#+END_SRC
*** Python
Python is great is it not 🐍
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq! +python-ipython-command '("ipython3" "-i" "--simple-prompt" "--no-color-info"))
(set-repl-handler! 'python-mode #'+python/open-ipython-repl)
#+END_SRC

*** LaTeX
turns out doom has support for latexmk already
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq +latex-viewers '(pdf-tools))
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(map! :map cdlatex-mode-map
      :i "TAB" #'cdlatex-tab)
#+END_SRC
*** TODO Web
I just find the tidy formatter indent functionality annoying and redundant. so
I changed it
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setenv "HTML_TIDY" (expand-file-name "tidy.conf" doom-private-dir))
(setq +format-on-save-enabled-modes
      '(not web-mode))
#+end_src

#+begin_src conf :tangle tidy.conf
indent: no  
indent-spaces: 4
gnu-emacs: yes
#+end_src
** email
*** mu4e
Whats better than email? email in emacs! mu4e has been fine for me so I dont
think I will

Setting my email using ~set-email-acount~. its a simple affair If you are stuck
on the folders remember that they come from what you set in your [[https://github.com/jeetelongname/dotfiles/blob/master/mail/.mbsyncrc#L31][mail fetcher config]]
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(set-email-account! "gmail"
                    '((mu4e-sent-folder       . "/gmail/\[Gmail\]/Sent Mail")
                      (mu4e-drafts-folder     . "/gmail/\[Gmail\]/Drafts")
                      (mu4e-trash-folder      . "/gmail/\[Gmail\]/Trash")
                      (mu4e-refile-folder     . "/gmail/\[Gmail\]/All Mail")
                      (smtpmail-smtp-user     . "jeetelongname@gmail.com"))t)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(after! mu4e
  (setq smtpmail-smtp-server "smtp.gmail.com"
        smtpmail-smtp-service 25))
#+END_SRC


I use msmtp to send my mail as its a little faster and has room for expansion
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq sendmail-program (executable-find "msmtp")
      send-mail-function #'smtpmail-send-it
      message-sendmail-f-is-evil t
      message-sendmail-extra-arguments '("--read-envelope-from")
      message-send-mail-function #'message-send-mail-with-sendmail)
#+end_src

Adding some keybinding under local-leader. this should make it a little easier to
do mail stuff. I do like =C-c C-c= to send tho
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! (:map org-msg-edit-mode-map
       :n "<tab>" #'org-msg-tab
       :localleader
       (:prefix "m"
        "k" #'org-msg-edit-kill-buffer
        "s" #'message-goto-subject
        "b" #'org-msg-goto-body
        "a" #'org-msg-attach)))
#+end_src

These are the settings for org-msg I may switch them to a snippet tho as I can
toggle the kind of signature I want to use then
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(after! mu4e
  (setq
   ;; org-msg-default-alternatives '(html)
   org-msg-greeting-fmt "\nHi *%s*,\n\n"
   org-msg-signature "\nRegards,
 ,#+begin_signature
 -- *Jeetaditya Chatterjee* \\\\
 /Sent using my text editor/
 ,#+end_signature"))
#+END_SRC

I don't like the default replied face
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces! '(mu4e-replied-face :foreground "#e95678" :inherit font-lock-builtin-face))
#+end_src

I update my mail when I feel like it so this is a little redundant for me
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! mu4e-alert :disable t)
#+end_src
** App
*** irc
I have a beard and I do like wasting time...
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! circe
  (set-irc-server! "chat.freenode.net"
                   '(:tls t
                     :port 6697

                     :sasl-username ,"yeetadita"
                     :sasl-password (+pass-get-secret "social/freenode")
                     :channels ("#emacs"))))
#+end_src
*** rss
I have not used it in months but i will probably revise it some point
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(after! elfeed
  (setq elfeed-search-filter "@1-week-ago")
  (setq rmh-elfeed-org-files (list (concat org-directory "elfeed.org"))) ;; +org
  (add-hook! 'elfeed-search-mode-hook 'elfeed-update))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; (use-package! elfeed-goodies
;;   :config
;;   (elfeed-goodies/setup))
#+END_SRC

* Epilogue
And that was my config! I hope you liked it! If you did not then you can make an
[[https://github.com/jeetelongname/.doom/issues][issue]] and if you just want to say I suck then i guess you can use that for that
too. I guess this is it for me... I am going back to bed

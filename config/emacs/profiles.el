;;  package --- a bootloader configuarion for emacs
;;; Commentary:
;;; This is my profiles.el found in .config/chemacs
;;; The default will load normally whole
;;; Code:

((mine      . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/emacs/myemacs/"))) ;; probably will become a test bed
 (spacemacs . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/emacs/spacemacs")))) ;; need to remove spacemacs I am not giving it a fair go (doom is just that good)
 ;; ("nano"      . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/emacs/nano-emacs")))) ;; nano does not have an init file


;;; .emacs-profiles.el ends here
